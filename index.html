                        <h2> KATE ROYCE</h2>
                        <p> I am Kate Royce Nagac Ternate, 20 years old and currently residing at Zone 6 Capisnon, Kauswagan Cagayan de Oro City. As of the moment, I am taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at USTP. I took up this course in search for seeking a job in abroad someday. I am an only child but I have a lot of cousins and we are extended family in the house. I love to do a lot of things especially when it involves outside activity. Growing up, I had a lot of realizations that I believed molded my personality and skills. I may lack in a lot of things but I strive hard for the people I live for.</p>

                        <p>My goals in life are ultimately to achieve success in life. My goals are to also have happiness, prosperity in every area in my life, and the freedom and peace within to be able to carry out my goals. My goals are also heavily influenced on the hardships my parents have had to endure such as facing ridicule for the simple fact of being immigrants, the extremely difficult time they endured due to unemployment and living in poverty, and the low degree of education they received from their countries. My goals are so important to me because I view it as way out of barely getting by, out of a harder life </p>
